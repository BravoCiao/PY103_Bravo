# to be honest, i couldn't understand python's handbook...

# i checked the Youtube video, if we type 'w' for writing, then python creates
# a new file, and the previous one will be deleted
# if we type 'a' for append, then python will open the old one
# to add more text
# r+ allows you to read AND write
# w+ allows you to write AND read
# but what's the difference between r+ and w+
